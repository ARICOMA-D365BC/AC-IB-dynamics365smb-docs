<blockquote>
<p>Update 01.04.2022</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Multiple Payment Methods</strong> module extends the standard of sales documents in the area of balancing the document directly during posting.
On sales invoice or sales credit note documents, instead of one payment method, it is now possible to define multiple payment methods, typically partly by credit card and partly in cash.</p>
<p>The functionality extends the possibilities of setting rules to users even if one payment method is used, both on sales and purchase documents. The aim is to reduce user errors by assigning users to specific &quot;payment places&quot;.
In practice, however, it happens that a customer wants to pay on the spot in cash a receipt that should have been paid by bank transfer. Then it is also possible to use the functionality of the module and define the combination of payment on the posted invoice (credit memo) or on the issued advance.
It is possible to use all three counter-account options included in the localization (Financial Account, Bank Account, Cashier) to record the settlement counter-account. However, the most common is the use of <strong>the Cashier as a counter-account</strong>, which allows combining the use of Multiple Payment Methods and Cash Receipts and brings with it rounding advantages (it is automatically resolved only on the cash receipt).</p>
<div class="WARNING">
<h5>Warning</h5>
<p>The module forms the basis for supporting retail sales in the form of Cash&amp;Carry. The functionality is not available on purchase orders (generally on sales/purchase documents where partial invoicing is possible). If you add it to these documents, then you must treat potentially conflicting states programmatically or methodically.
The option to define multiple payment methods is not available by default on any purchase document, but can be added there as part of the customer extension functionality.</p>

If the receipt is unrounded, rounding of the cash to be refunded takes place only when posting the settlement through the rounding set in the Cash Receipts functionality.</p>

<h2 id="records-of-payment--simplified-regime">Records of payment – simplified regime</h2>
<p>In case the customer wants to settle the document when charging by one method only, e.g. by bank card, the simplified mode can be used by entering the selected Payment Method Code directly in the document header.</p>

<p>It is a relatively common practice that the preferred or allowed payment method (typically cash payment) is defined on customer cards. However, when there are more than one such code (due to record keeping requirements), it is necessary to ensure that the document is posted with the code appropriate to the user posting the document. If &quot;Check payment method on sales document&quot; is enabled, the system will make the change automatically (see <a href="https://www.aricoma.com/docs/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/FinancialPack/multiple-payment-methods-setup.html#payment-methods-settings">Setting up Payment Methods</a>).</p>

<h2 id="eet-records-directly-from-the-payment-schedule">EET records directly from the Payment Schedule</h2>
<p>In some cases, it is required to create a register of EET (legislation in the Czech Republic) already on the payment schedule, i.e. before the document is posted (e.g. for printing documents for the implementation of cash on delivery, etc.).</p>
<p>If Enable EET registration is enabled, the Register EET action is available on the payment schedule, resp. Cancel EET (see <a href="https://www.aricoma.com/docs/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/FinancialPack/multiple-payment-methods-setup.html#payment-methods-settings">Payment Methods Settings</a>).</p>
