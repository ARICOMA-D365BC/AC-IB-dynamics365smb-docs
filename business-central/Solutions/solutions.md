# Autocont changes to Aricoma
Autocont is changing. Like the other brands in the group, it adopts the new name Aricoma. This brings together companies focused on IT infrastructure, cloud technology, enterprise applications, cybersecurity, public sector digitalization and systems integration. As Aricoma, we want to offer customers an extension of services and solutions under a single brand and a more comprehensive approach to their needs.


# Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central is a modern information system for small and medium-sized companies looking for a simple and easily customizable solution with comprehensive coverage of their needs and an intuitive user experience. It offers increased productivity and competitiveness, saves upfront investment and reduces operational and safety concerns.

Online system operation in the cloud has a major advantage in lower initial implementation costs, ensured security, and easier system updates. Users can connect from a computer, smartphone or tablet with Google Android or Apple iOS.
